We can't stress enough how much we value all your feedback. To make things easier for you, we created [numerous channels to reach us](https://www.bitrise.io/contact), including email, Slack, HipChat, Twitter, UserVoice and through GitHub issues.


Another thing we have to consider, though, is giving you the best tech support. And this means managing all these channels and keeping track of everyone's needs. Lately there has been an increasing amount of support traffic, and we see that a cool little community is starting to form. We love that! But if the family grows we need to be focused not to leave out anybody from the party.


**This is why we decided to remove HipChat from our channels.** HipChat was good, because it enables a quick live chat, and users don't need to register to join.
But we can't notify you, if you left the chat and there is no private chat option. The last one is crucial, because usually we have to request some confidential information so we can resolve the respective issue.

However, we accepted Slack as our lord and savior, because it has all these features! Only downside: you have to register, but that's just a few seconds (and Slack is an emoji-filled awesomeness).
So [head over to our Slack](http://chat.bitrise.io) to chat with the Bitrise team or the rest of the community, or to request tech support!
