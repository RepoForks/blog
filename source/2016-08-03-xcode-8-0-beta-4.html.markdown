Xcode 8.0 beta 4 is now available! ðŸŽ‰


__Notes__: Good news, beta 4 fixes the hanging tests issue of the previous Xcode 8 betas!
([more info about the issue](https://bitrise-io.github.io/devcenter/ios/known-xcode-issues/#xcode-8-xcodebuild-test-hangs-at-the-very-end-of-the-tests))
Another thing which changed since Xcode 7: Xcode's Archive command (any command which requires
code signing, actually. Note: if all you want to do is to run `test`
on the project, that does not require it) now requires the Team / Team ID to be set in your Xcode project.
In Xcode 7 you could leave this property empty, which was useful if you had to build
your project with multiple code signing files, from different teams, but since Xcode 8
you have to set the Team (ID).


__To select this Stack__ you just have to **open your app** on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io),
go to the `Settings` tab, and at the bottom of the Settings tab select the `Xcode 8 beta`
stack option, and your next build will start on the Xcode 8.0 beta stack.

This new Virtual Machine replaced the previous, Xcode 8.0 beta 3 configuration,
so **if you've already selected this Xcode 8 Beta stack for your app,
you're automatically using beta 4 now**.

__You can find the Stack's__ full __system report__ at:
[https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/blob/master/system_reports/osx-xcode-8.0.x.log](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/blob/master/system_reports/osx-xcode-8.0.x.log),
and the changes since the beta 3 stack:

If you'd like to add a tool to be pre-installed on our Stacks
you can find all the required information at: [https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io#request-a-tool-to-be-pre-installed](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io#request-a-tool-to-be-pre-installed).

**Happy Building!** ðŸš€
