We'll perform a scheduled maintenance at Saturday morning.

**Bitrise will be unaccessible during the maintenance**,
no new build will be registered through the Github and Bitbucket hooks
or through the Bitrise Build Trigger API during the maintenance.


## What's the purpose of the maintenance?

The maintenance is required to safely manage the transition
from our previous Build Workflow system to a new system
which is completely built on the
open source [StepLib](http://www.steplib.com/){:target="_blank"} specification
and format.

We'll deploy our new Workflow Editor as well and a couple
of related additional features which were requested by
the community - for example you'll be able to export your
Workflow, to save it anywhere you want to and to import it
to another app.


## Schedule

**The maintenance is scheduled to:**
Saturday, January 10th

**Duration:**
Starts at: 10am UTC; Ends at: 11am UTC (planned)

Please let us know if you have problems with the maintenance schedule.


## Status

No changes in the schedule or scope of the maintenance so far.
