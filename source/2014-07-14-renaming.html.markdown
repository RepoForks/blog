As we're moving forward to our public beta we try to finalize the things both
under the hood and on the UI.

One of the major remaining tasks on our todo list was the renaming of the service.
We used "concrete" as the codename of the project for a long time.

We kinda loved the name too, but it's too general - which means no social
accounts are available - and there's also an Open Source CI project on GitHub.

After weeks of discussion about the name we finally found the one we're happy with: **Bitrise**

It's short, it's "techy" and it perfectly fits with our company's name (Bitfall).

We're still cleaning up our codes and doing the renaming. We hope to finish
it during the week - in the meantime there might be some places where you'll
still see "concrete" instead of Bitrise. Feel free to report it to us if you find one.

A quick note about the public release:
it's planned for the end of the week. Most of the systems are already in
place and you can even try it at [https://www.bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io){:target="_blank"} - but
keep in mind that we're in the middle of a final system revision and so
things might broke during the week.

Farewell to concrete and welcome to Bitrise!
