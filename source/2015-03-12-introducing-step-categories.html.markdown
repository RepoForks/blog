As our Step collection grows it gets more important
to provide an easy way for you to find the steps you
want to add to your Workflow. So far you could only
search the list of steps which is fine if you know
what you're looking for but not really helpful
if you would just browse through the available Steps
to see which one would fit you the best.

The Step specification includes #tags for a while now
and Bitrise now supports
this information to provide you an easy way of filtering
the steps list based on the most frequently used
step types.

You can now filter the steps list by the following
categories (tags) when you click on the *add new step*
button in your app's Workflow Editor:

* **deploy**: these steps provide you an easy way of storing and managing your app's builds.
* **notifications**: get notified about your builds or tests the way you want to: Slack, HipChat, Text message or email; you can find a step for you.
* **script**: useful if you want to glue things together or do any custom action you want to.
* **build**: all the essential build actions, including *Xcode version selection*, *Xcode analyze* and *Xcode create archive*.

We'll certainly update the category list from time to time
to provide you the best selections for the most common actions
you might want to automate with Bitrise and we have a couple of other
feature idea on our list to help you browse through the
available steps.
