We are growing rapidly day by day, which is just amazing! We are thrilled that we can offer a piece of happiness through automation to more and more people around the world. But this also means that we have to watch our tech more closely to make the platform as smooth as possible for you.
So although it's not spring yet, we're going to have some spring-cleaning on our servers: dusting off the hard drives, color coding the cables and polishing the build lanes one by one.

> The maintenance will be on this **Saturday, January 30th from 10.00 to 11.00 (UTC)**. During this time you won't be able to access the website or start new builds.

We are very sorry for any inconvenience this might cause. You can follow the status of the maintenance on our [status page](http://status.bitrise.io).
