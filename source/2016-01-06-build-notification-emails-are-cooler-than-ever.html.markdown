Let's be honest, the notification emails that tell you when your build failed or succeeded could use some redecoration. Although a lot is going on behind the scenes, this was a quick fix long overdue and now it's finally ready!


But the awesome thing is that you don't just get a new, easier to comprehend design. Now you can also configure when you'd like to receive these emails in a little more sophisticated way.

The new options include getting emails on success only if the build has been `repaired`, a.k.a. after failing it became green again - we all love that feeling very much, so this feature will make this occasion even more special.

A similar, but sadder situation is when your build `breaks`. Time to debug like crazy - again. Now you'll get notified about this as well, so you know when it's time to try that new swear word you learned while assembling the Christmas tree last year.

Another handy improvement is that you'll notice aborted build emails more easily, since they became yellow just like on Bitrise. Consistency!


Of course, you can leave it as is, so you'll get a new email every time your build finished, if that's what you fancy.


So all in all: have fun with your cleaner inbox!
