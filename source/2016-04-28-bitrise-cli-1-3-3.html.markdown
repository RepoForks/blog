## All Stacks

We discovered a regression introduced in Bitrise CLI `1.3.0`,
which could cause the `is_pull_request_allowed: false` Trigger Map modifier
to be skipped in some cases when it should not.

[Bitrise CLI `1.3.3`](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/releases/tag/1.3.3) fixes this regression,
with proper unit and integration tests, as well as another non critical regression which did not
affect builds on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).


## OS X Stacks: Cache update

All OS X Stacks were updated with the Bitrise CLI `1.3.3` version.
No other changes were applied.


## Android / Linux (Docker) Stack

In addition to the Bitrise CLI `1.3.3` update the Linux stack received
two additional pre-installed tool version update:

* `Gradle` : `2.12` -> `2.13`
* `fastlane` : `1.81.0` -> `1.82.0`


## Stack / System Reports
