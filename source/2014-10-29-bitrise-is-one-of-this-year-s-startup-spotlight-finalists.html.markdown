We're happy to announce that Bitrise was selected as one of
the [32 finalists of How to Web Startup Spotlight](http://www.startupspotlight.co/participants/){:target="_blank"}!

Bitrise was (silently) launched just a month ago and was already
submitted to [Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com/posts/bitrise){:target="_blank"} the last weekend which resulted in a lot of new sign up.

We're thrilled to have so many new iOS developers on-board
and the possibility to improve Bitrise together with you!

If you happen to be around Bucharest during the Startup Spotlight
competition (19-22 November 2014) and would like to meet us
drop an email to **letsconnect@bitrise.io**.

We would be happy to talk with you about Bitrise,
iOS continuous delivery and build automation.

If you can't meet us at the competition you
can also [chat with us online](http://www.bitrise.io/contact).
