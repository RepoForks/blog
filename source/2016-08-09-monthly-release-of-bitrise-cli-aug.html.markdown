Read on to learn more about this month's [Bitrise CLI](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise) release and about the changes around bitrise tools and steps.

## New version of Bitrise CLI (1.3.7)

__Bitrise version 1.3.7 contains major updates around workflow run related commands' flags (`run`, `trigger` and `trigger-check`) and feature/internal tools handling.__

This update prepares the bitrise cli for the __new trigger handling__, which will include __pull request__ and git __tagging__ trigger support. You can find more details [on this github proposal](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/issues/40).

#### run command

From now you can specify __workflow id to run__ with `--workflow` flag for `bitrise run` command.  
Example: `bitrise run --workflow WORKFLOW_ID`.  
_In previous versions you were able to specify workflow id to run as a command argument (`bitrise run WORKFLOW_ID`); this method is still supported._

#### trigger command

Similar to run command's new `--workflow` flag, `trigger` and `trigger-check` commands also received new flag for specifying the __trigger pattern__: `--pattern`.  
Example: `bitrise trigger --pattern PATTERN`.  
_In previous versions you were able to specify the pattern as a command argument (`bitrise trigger PATTERN`); this method is still supported._

#### json-params

Every workflow run related commands (`run`, `trigger`, `trigger-check`) now have new inputs:

  - `--json-params`
  - `--json-params-base64`.

You can use `--json-params` to specify __every available command flags__ (_except --json-params and --json-params-base64_) in a single json struct. This json struct should be a string-string map, where every key is the command flag's name, and the value should be the flag's value.  

For example:   
`bitrise run --config bitrise.yml --workflow primary`

Equivalent with json-params:  
`bitrise run --json-params '{"config":"bitrise.yml", "workflow":"primary"}'`  

To see the command's available flags, call `bitrise COMMAND -h`.

If you want to avoid character escaping side effects while running the `bitrise` cli, you can base64 encode --json-params value and pass to bitrise cli using the `--json-params-base64` flag.

#### feature/internal tools

__The `envman` and `stepman` (used by `bitrise`) tools install path is moved from `/usl/local/bin` to `$HOME/.bitrise/tools`__ to make sure bitrise cli uses the desired tool version.  
Also `stepman` min version updated to [0.9.22](https://github.com/bitrise-io/stepman/releases/tag/0.9.22).
