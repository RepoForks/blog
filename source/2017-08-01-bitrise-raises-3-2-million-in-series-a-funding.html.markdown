__Weâ€™re happy to announce the closing of our Series A funding round of $3.2 million. It was led by [OpenOcean](http://openocean.vc), joined by [Y Combinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/), [Fiedler Capital](http://www.fiedlercapital.com/) and other notable angel investors.__

We are very proud to be __the first Hungarian startup to get into Y Combinator__ and using our knowledge and funding we plan to build the ecosystem in Hungary and also expand our US office. We have exciting plans for the Bitrise platform as well - our roadmap includes taking the whole developer integration library to __the next level with new add-ons like user analytics and reporting, as well as rolling out an enterprise support solution__. (Details coming soon!)

Weâ€™d like to become an "all-inclusive" central gateway for mobile developers to handle all their development needs, so weâ€™ll continue to focus on __building a strong open source community on top of our core product__. This means that, in contrast to most hosted CI services, we donâ€™t require the resources to build all tools in-house: we can both grow with our community, and feed back into it.

##Not a long time ago in a county far, far away....
As you may know Bitrise was co-founded by Barnabas Birmacher, Daniel Balla and Viktor Benei in October 2014. Prior to Bitrise, the three co-founders experienced the developersâ€™ struggle first hand when founding their development agency and building iOS and Android apps for clients.

"We created Bitrise in response to our frustrations whilst working at our development agency, Bitfall. Having to go through the manual tasks when someone needed a fresh build or when bugs piled up before app releases proved to be time consuming and took us away from the elements of development that we loved. We wanted to automate the manual aspects of development so we could focus on innovation and creativity." said Barnabas Birmacher (CEO)

Daniel Balla (CPO) continues: "As developers ourselves, we wanted to make setting up and maintaining CI much easier, without scripting, but at the same level of customizability. We've developed a simple-to-use workflow and step system where steps are ready-made and reusable building blocks responsible for one task. All of these steps are open source - and since inception the library has grown to over 130 integrations, with about 40 contributed by the community. We constantly seek to speak to our users through Slack or our discuss forum, and incorporate features they wish for most into our roadmap."

__Weâ€™d like to thank everybody supporting us and all the open source contributors.__ ðŸ™Œ  

Stay tuned for our next big shots! ðŸŽ†
