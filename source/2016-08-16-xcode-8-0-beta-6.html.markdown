Xcode 8.0 beta 6 is now available! ðŸŽ‰


__Notes__: This is the first bitrise.io Mac OS virtual machine which features
a 200GB base storage - out of which about 121 GB is free right now on this stack.

Newer Xcode versions now come with a huge range of Simulators, including
iOS, tvOS and Apple Watch ones. Compared to Xcode 7, Xcode 8 takes significantly
more disk space, once all the available simulators are installed.

In case of this stack this wasn't an issue, there was about 20GB free disk space
before, but our other Mac OS stacks are built on top of the base Xcode stacks,
which meant that on the Xamarin stacks (where Xamarin and Android are also installed,
in addition to Xcode) there was less than 10 GB free disk space.
As we'll keep adding support for more and more tools, and adding more preinstalled
tools along the process it was crucial to increase the available disk space
for upcoming stacks.

Another new thing in this Stack: it was built on the latest and gratest (non beta) Mac OS
version, `10.11.6`, instead of `10.11.5` we used for previous versions of this Stack.
This stack was built as a completely new Virtual Machine,
doing a brand new Mac OS install, to test and validate our provisioning scripts
from start to finish, preparing for Mac OS Sierra.
Everything what was used during the provisioning / creation of the virtual machine image
can be found on GitHub at [https://github.com/bitrise-io/osx-box-bootstrap](https://github.com/bitrise-io/osx-box-bootstrap),
and nothing else was used for creating it!


__To select this Stack__ you just have to **open your app** on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io),
go to the `Settings` tab, and at the bottom of the Settings tab select the `Xcode 8 beta`
stack option, and your next build will start on the Xcode 8.0 beta stack.

This new Virtual Machine replaced the previous Xcode 8.0 beta configuration,
so **if you've already selected the Xcode 8 Beta stack for your app,
you're automatically using beta 6 now**.

__You can find the Stack's__ full __system report__ at:
[https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/blob/master/system_reports/osx-xcode-8.0.x.log](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/blob/master/system_reports/osx-xcode-8.0.x.log),
and the changes compared to the previous beta stack:

If you'd like to add a tool to be pre-installed on our Stacks
you can find all the required information at: [https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io#request-a-tool-to-be-pre-installed](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io#request-a-tool-to-be-pre-installed).

**Happy Building!** ðŸš€
