Last week we visited the [How to Web](http://2014.howtoweb.co/){:target="_blank"} conference.
We were one of the 32 lucky startups who participated in the
Startup Spotlight startup competition.

It was an amazing event, we could meet with developers, investors, PR specialists
and other mentors - in fact we could connect with as many helpful people during
this few days as we could otherwise in months!

*The event itself was organized in a very professional way,
if you can make it next year we would definitely advise you to do so.*

We'll process the tremendous amount of feedback we got in the upcoming
weeks and in the meantime **we'll finally start to roll out the
new site design** and other user experience revisions
to make it easier to get started and to work with Bitrise.
