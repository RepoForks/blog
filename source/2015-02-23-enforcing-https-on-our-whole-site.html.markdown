We always try to provide secure solutions for our whole platform
and as part of this **we now enforce https on every Bitrise page and endpoint**.
This means that if you try to access Bitrise through http
you'll be redirected to the https endpoint, on all of our
pages on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io/){:target="_blank"}.

You shouldn't have to do anything except if you use our
Build Trigger API with the auto generated cURL command
which you can get on your App's `Code tab`. cURL unfortunately
does not properly redirect from http to https with the
parameters it was generated by the cURL configurator previously.

**If you use our Build Trigger API based on the auto generated
cURL command you should update the URL from http to https**.

We also updated our [Terms of Service](https://www.bitrise.io/terms){:target="_blank"} and
[Privacy Policy](https://www.bitrise.io/privacy){:target="_blank"} pages replacing the
http URLs on the pages with their https equivalent.

Security always plays an important role in our development process
and we always try to provide the most reliable service
but with any major change like this there's a high probability of
breaking something. **If you would experience any issues
please [contact us](http://www.bitrise.io/contact?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=bitrise){:target="_blank"}
