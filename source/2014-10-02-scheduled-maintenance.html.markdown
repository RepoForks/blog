> **Update**: maintenance finished, every subsystem turned back on.

We'll perform a scheduled maintenance at Saturday morning.

Bitrise will be unaccessible during the maintenance,
no new build will be registered through the Github and Bitbucket hooks
or through the Bitrise Build Trigger API to prevent data loss
while we update our databases and our queue system.

## Schedule

**The maintenance is scheduled at:**
Saturday, October 4

**Duration:**
Starts at: 8am UTC; Ends at: 10am UTC (planned)

Please let us know if you have problems with the maintenance schedule.

## Status

The maintenance is now finished. We're still closely monitoring
the system for issues introduced with the maintenance - so far none discovered.

If you find a bug feel free to reach us, we'll investigate it ASAP.
