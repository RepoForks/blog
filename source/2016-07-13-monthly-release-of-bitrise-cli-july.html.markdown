Read on to learn more about this month's [Bitrise CLI](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise) release and about the changes around bitrise tools and steps.

## New version of Bitrise CLI (1.3.6)

__Bitrise version 1.3.6 contains minor fixes and updates, the relevant change is the new Stepman [v0.9.21](https://github.com/bitrise-io/stepman/releases/tag/0.9.21) dependency.__

From now on the build log's summary contains a "Not provided" message if `source_code_url` or `support_url` is missing. The update contains some typo fixes and guide updates.

## New version of Stepman (0.9.21)

__This stepman release contains major updates around `step-info` and `step-list` commands, also a new command wired in for exporting the StepLib spec: `export-spec`.__


We decided to remove every command's short version (a.k.a. command alias), because it was not representative enough and the overlap between `download` and `delete` commands' alias (`d`) caused a conflict.

`step-info` command's `collection` input - *which you can use to specify the StepLib as source of the step* - is now __required__, to make it less confusing, when multiple StepLibs contain the same step.

We improved the logging of the `step-list` command, to make it clear which StepLib contains the step list.

You can now generate the StepLib's spec - *spec.json is a descriptor for the StepLib, used by other parts of bitrise (like the website, or the integrations page)* - by calling `stepman export-spec` command.
You can control the functionality with the following flags:

- `--steplib`: specify the StepLib with the StepLib's git URI
- `--output`: where stepman should save the exported spec file
- `--export-type`: controls what should be included in the spec - available options:

  - `full`: contains all meta information about the StepLib and every version of all steps along with their information
  - `latest`: contains all meta information about the StepLib, but steps are presented only with their latest version
  - `minimal`:  contains all meta information about the StepLib, but only step-ids are presented

Previously there was no specific command to access the spec file - *`stepman steup` command's `--copy-spec-json` flag was used to access the spec, but there was no control over the spec content*.
