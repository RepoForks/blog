## Summary

As usual a new [Bitrise CLI](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise)
version was published on the second Tuesday of the month (this last Tuesday),
and as there was no show-stopper issue we updated the VMs this weekend to use the
latest Bitrise CLI version: `1.3.6` ðŸŽ‰

You can read more about the new CLI version in our previous blog post:
[Monthly release of Bitrise CLI (July)](/2016/07/13/monthly-release-of-bitrise-cli-july.html).

One more notable update: the Android / Linux stack now has Node.js v6 pre-installed! ðŸ˜±
The Node.js version right now is the same on the macOS "Edge" stack and on the
Linux / Android stack (`v6.3.0`) and will be updated on both at every weekend.


## macOS Stacks

As usual, all of the macOS Stacks received a dependency manager cache (`brew`, `cocoapods` and `bitrise CLI`) update.
*These Cache updates __do not__ change the pre-installed tool versions, it's
only an update of package manager caches, for faster dependency installs.*

**The only exception is the "Edge" stack, which is re-built every week**,
so it includes the latest-and-greatest versions of the pre-installed tools,
not just dependency manager cache updates.

As everything else we use for
provisioning the macOS VMs, the weekly cache update `Ansible` playbook
[can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/bitrise-io/osx-box-bootstrap/blob/master/weekly-cache-update-playbook.yml).

## Xamarin Stacks

Xamarin Stacks are based on the OS X stacks, so the dependency manager cache updates are applied
on these stacks too (see the `OS X Stacks: Dependency manager cache updates` section for more detail).

In addition to the dependency manager cache updates Xamarin Stacks are upgraded to the latest
Xamarin Studio versions on every weekend.
