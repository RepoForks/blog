For those of you who haven't heard yet: we now have our very own open source [Command Line Interface](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise)! Woot-woot!


It's a very useful little tool, if you ask us. You can use the `bitrise.yml` format to create and configure workflows using the [same integrations](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations) you would use on Bitrise, and run them on your own, precious machine. Very cool stuff for debugging errors, initial testing or even for developing a new Step.


Oh, and don't worry about a complicated installation process. It's available in Homebrew, so the only thing you have to do is type `brew install bitrise` into your terminal and then MAGIC *(don't type* `magic`*, though, it's not a commandâ€¦ yet)*!


Just to add sprinkles on top, the CLI now has its [own landing page](https://www.bitrise.io/cli) with GIFs, monospace font and stuff. You really should check it out. Also share the good news with your friends, <s>or Santa will write `nasty` in your annual behavioral index</s>.


Here is a totally shareable link again, just for good measure:
