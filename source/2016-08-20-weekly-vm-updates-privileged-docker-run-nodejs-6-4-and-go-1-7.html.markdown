## Summary

Probably the most significant change is that we now run the Linux/Android docker images
with the `--privileged` flag (`docker run --privileged ..`).
This was an important step, to allow you truly full control on the Linux/Android stack,
which can be required to [configure a VPN connection](https://github.com/bitrise-docker/bitrise-base/issues/26)
for example.

__This does not affect your builds' security__, as we don't run more than one Docker container
on a Build virtual machine, and the whole virtual machine is discarded after the build, not just
the Docker container.

Additional tool highlight: the Android/Linux stack and the Xcode Edge stack
now have `NodeJS` v6.4, and `Go` 1.7 preinstalled,
as well as `fastlane` v1.101.0.


## macOS Stacks

As usual, all of the macOS Stacks received a dependency manager cache (`brew`, `cocoapods` and `bitrise CLI`) update.
*These Cache updates __do not__ change the pre-installed tool versions, it's
only an update of package manager caches, for faster dependency installs.*

**The only exception is the "Edge" stack, which is re-built every week**,
so it includes the latest-and-greatest versions of the pre-installed tools,
not just dependency manager cache updates.

As everything else we use for
provisioning the macOS VMs, the weekly cache update `Ansible` playbook
[can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/bitrise-io/osx-box-bootstrap/blob/master/weekly-cache-update-playbook.yml).

## Android / Linux (Docker) Stack

You can find this week's Stack `diff`s on GitHub:

* Ubuntu 16.04: [diff](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/pull/59/commits/d01b1e15855b6c757d007de44a28b670359c4372) / [full system report](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/blob/master/system_reports/docker-based-android-setup.log)


## Xamarin Stacks

Xamarin Stacks are based on the OS X stacks, so the dependency manager cache updates are applied
on these stacks too (see the `OS X Stacks: Dependency manager cache updates` section for more detail).

In addition to the dependency manager cache updates Xamarin Stacks are upgraded to the latest
Xamarin Studio versions on every weekend.

## Stack / System Reports

You can find the full system report of all of the available Stacks
on GitHub: [https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/tree/master/system_reports](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/tree/master/system_reports).

If you'd like to add additional tools to be pre-installed you can find the
instructions on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io#request-a-tool-to-be-pre-installed-on-a-build-machine),
for both the Linux and for the OS X stacks.

**Happy Building!** ðŸš€
