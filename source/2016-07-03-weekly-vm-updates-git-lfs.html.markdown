## Summary

This week's main changes are related to `git`. These changes
are now available if you use the `Xcode "Edge"` or `Linux/Android` stacks,
*other stacks were not updated with these changes*.

Both `Xcode "Edge"` and `Linux/Android` stacks are now configured
in a way to make it easy for you to push back into your repository.
We still think that pushing anything back to your repository from an
automation environment is usually not a good idea, as it might lead
to infinite build cycles (where the git push will trigger a new build,
which will trigger a new build, ...), as well as should be considered
really carefully, to make it sure you do not delete files by accident
in an automation environment.

That said, a common workflow for many teams involves pushing git tags
back to the repository, which is now really simple on the updated
stacks - you don't have to configure anything, it just works,
you can run `git push --tags` and it'll work (if you configured your
repository with proper read-write SSH key access).

The second `git` related change is that __[git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com)__
is now preinstalled and configured on both stacks (`Xcode "Edge"` and `Linux/Android`).
It wasn't an impossible thing to do even before, but you now don't have
to do anything if your repository uses __Git LFS__. It just works (the motto
of this update it seems ðŸ˜‰).


## macOS Stacks

As usual, all of the macOS Stacks received a dependency manager cache (`brew`, `cocoapods` and `bitrise CLI`) update.
*These Cache updates __do not__ change the pre-installed tool versions, it's
only an update of package manager caches, for faster dependency installs.*

**The only exception is the "Edge" stack, which is re-built every week**,
so it includes the latest-and-greatest versions of the pre-installed tools,
not just dependency manager cache updates.

As everything else we use for
provisioning the macOS VMs, the weekly cache update `Ansible` playbook
[can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/bitrise-io/osx-box-bootstrap/blob/master/weekly-cache-update-playbook.yml).

## Xamarin Stacks

Xamarin Stacks are based on the OS X stacks, so the dependency manager cache updates are applied
on these stacks too (see the `OS X Stacks: Dependency manager cache updates` section for more detail).

In addition to the dependency manager cache updates Xamarin Stacks are upgraded to the latest
Xamarin Studio versions on every weekend.
