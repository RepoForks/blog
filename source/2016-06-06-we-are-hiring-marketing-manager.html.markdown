![Marketing](marketing.jpeg)

We put an extraordinary amount of effort and love into building the best automation platform for mobile developers. We're looking for someone who can apply that same vision and thoughtfulness to our communication efforts.

You will be working closely with our dev team and creative team to streamline our CI platform and put Bitrise in front of the developer community. This means understanding the technical details of product development, understanding and having a strong product vision to be able to tell our story, and helping us create great content that connects with developers. We believe in the power of open source and building a stronger, closer relationship with our users, involving them in our journey and helping them create incredible apps.

We like you if you are keen on experimenting, wildly curious, always eager to challenge the status quo and possess interdisciplinary knowledge. We'd like to feel a strong urge to just sit down and have a beer with you and talk endlessly.

##You must have:

- Brand and marketing strategy experience
- Experience working with engineers and artists
- The ability to think through and reason your ideas and thoughts to a wider audience
- Fantastic written and verbal communication skills

##Bonus points:

- You have some design or development experience
- You previously marketed for developers

##About Bitrise

Bitrise is a Continuous Integration and Delivery platform focusing on mobile development. We help developers to automate their every-day tasks so they can go back to building great apps and have more time for their ideas. We'd like to create an ecosystem for software developers which they can use to build, test and distribute their apps in a way that it feels natural and fun. We take being open very seriously and we love to automate everything possible.

##Why you should join

We are a small, but extremely motivated team with a rapidly growing product and userbase. Everyone in the team has meaningful and important tasks, whatever you do will make a difference and whatever your ideas may be, it will be heard.
We like to look at people's trajectories rather than their status when looking for talent. We'd like to find people who will be with us on the long run while growing and improving with us.
