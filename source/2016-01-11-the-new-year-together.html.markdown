Everybody makes new year's resolutions, and everybody tends to break them by the end of the first week of January. That is statistics for you. *Our new year's resolution would be 3840x2160 pixels.*

But besides our UltraHD-ness, we have some promises for 2016, too. We always valued and respected the power of community and what it can do if the opportunity is presented to them. This is especially true to developers, who can come up with phenomenal things if given great tools and some inspiration.

One of our goals for this year will be to improve and expand these tools and give more power to those who like tinkering and experimenting with the service they use - like you'd do with an old Mustang. This means a new, friendly platform that makes it super easy to create, and most importantly share new Steps and Workflows with others. It will be like sharing recipes for as simple configurations like, say, scrambled eggs to as elaborate setups like some of those Michelin starred meals. It will be all up to you and we are curious what you all can come up with!

*(Like, did you know, that [we have a Step for a smart lightbulb to show build status](https://github.com/pisarm/steps-lifx)? How awesome is that!)*

Another thing we've been planning for a while is contributing to the local tech community IRL. Most of our team is in Budapest, Hungary, where the tech scene is still developing, tech people are not as outgoing as in London, for example. This doesn't mean that there isn't any talent here - from what we've seen a lot of developers have huge potential and most of them even get into major tech companies to prove their worth.

We want to challenge the status quo by organizing our very own meetup, [NSBudapest](http://www.meetup.com/NSBudapest/), for local iOS developers to share their knowledge and interests. The first event will be very soon, on [January 19th](http://www.meetup.com/NSBudapest/events/227291358/), so if you happen to be in Budapest, come by to say hi! If not, we'll stream the whole thing and even share the whole video afterwards.

And last but not least, our team is growing again! **We'll have our very own Developer Advocate** who has a pretty good track record both in iOS/Mac development and community building, and she is great at connecting with the tech world through multiple channels. [Agnes](https://twitter.com/vasarhelyia) will help us engage even more people and will join us on our mission to bring back the joy of mobile app development, and maybe [teach us how to make craft beer](http://brewfactory.org). Welcome aboard!

You can find [@vasarhelyia](https://twitter.com/vasarhelyia) on Twitter and read some interesting iOS/Mac related articles [on her blog](https://blog.alltheflow.com).

We are very excited for this year, and we are sure it will be a hell of a ride. So get in your space shuttles and fire up your FTL engines, because interesting news are coming really soon!
