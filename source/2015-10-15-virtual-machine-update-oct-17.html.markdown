> **Status**: the Virtual Machine passed our tests, ready for release.

*We now have the new virtual machine prepared and it
passed our initial tests, so we now have the pre-installed tool
version change list, we expect this to be the complete list of updates.*

These are the most significant updates:

* `Xcode 7 beta 3` will replace `beta 2`
* Pre-installed `CocoaPods` updated from `0.38.2` to `0.39.0`
* Our [Bitrise CLI](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise){:target="_blank"} also received a patch update: `1.2.1` -> `1.2.2`

As always you can check all the pre-installed tool version
changes on our DevCenter at [Virtual Machines / Box #changelog](http://devcenter.bitrise.io/docs/vm-box-changelog){:target="_blank"}.
