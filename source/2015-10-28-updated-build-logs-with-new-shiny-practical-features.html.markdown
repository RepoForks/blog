Good news, everyone! We've just upgraded the build logs on Bitrise with some pretty awesome features, that you've all been waiting for. Section collapsing, Step icons, log following, build aborting and more!


##Step icons are back!


We brought back the Step icons to mark the start of every Step, giving you a bit of help, when browsing through the lines of code. But we didn't stop there. Now you can collapse or expand Steps, whether you want to see just the Step header and footer, or the whole of the log output. A little orange circle will also show up in the corner of the Step icons, whenever there's an update available for it. This will come in handy!

##Follow that log!


By learning how to say `vingardium leviosa` properly (hint: not leviossah, leviooosa), we were able to add the *follow log* feature to this new log design. It was a stupid thing, when you had to press `jump to bottom` a hundred times. Now that's gone as well.


##Finally here: abort your in-progress builds


This feature was long overdue, but we finally came around and did it. Now there's a friendly orange button that you can press to abort any running build, no need to wait for it to finish. Now you can scream *Mission abort!* whenever you cancel your builds - you are welcome. That same button changes to `rebuild` when the build finishes. This feature was a bit hidden until now: not cool.

##Wicked build details redesign

Have a better overview of your running or completed builds with this new look. This is part of our overall Bitrise redesign process, so expect tons of new changes in the coming weeks - it's worth the wait. This new page brings back the progress bar, a status indicator below the logs, so no need to scroll to the top and, of course, the new log output.


We hope you like these new improvements, we sure as hell do (yes, Bitrise uses Bitrise, too)! Have fun, rejoice, tweet, shout out to the world and don't stop building! * *rushes to Defense Against the Dark Arts Class* *
