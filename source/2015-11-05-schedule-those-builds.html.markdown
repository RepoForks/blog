I once attended an event where the lead designer of [Citymapper](https://citymapper.com/), Gil Wedam said, that they send out the latest version of their app every evening, so the team could test it on their way home. He went on to explain, how he even takes elaborate routes home every Friday after work to push Citymapper's limits. I think it's a great attitude, and probably that's why Citymapper feels so human centered and awesome.


Now every Bitrise user can do this automatically, because we made scheduling builds happen! Just push the `Start build` button as always and switch on scheduling. You can set the time of the build and the day(s) you want that particular branch built. It's pretty easy and straightforward.
Your scheduled builds will show up on your `Builds` tab above your build history. By default these are collapsed and a helpful text tells you when your next scheduled build will run. You can expand this section to manage and review all of your scheduled builds. But be warned, you can only delete a whole scheduling, but you can't do it for individual days.


This feature is not yet complete, that's why you can see the `beta` tag beside it, but we thought you could still benefit from it in this shape. If you'd need more than it offers now, write us an email with your suggestions or jump by to chat on our [Slack channel](http://chat.bitrise.io/)! We hope you'll enjoy this new automation method!
