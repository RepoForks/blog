Automating React Native apps on Bitrise? Sure thing! Let's see how! ðŸ¤–

1. Log in to Bitrise and __click `+Add new app`__ on your Dashboard!

2. __Connect your repository__ from your connected source code provider or add it manually.

3. __Setup repository access__ (See [DevCenter for detailed explanation](http://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/create-your-first-app-on-bitrise/#2-setup-repository-access?utm_source=bitriseblog&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=17w30reactnative)!)

4. __Validation setup__: choose a branch for our scanner, this will help automation. How about a cuppa coffee while we are scanning your app? :)

5. __Project build configuration__: our scanner will most likely have chosen React Native for your app. Yay! :) Select Scheme name!

7. __Webhook setup__: register a Webhook so that Bitrise can automatically start a build every time you push code into your repository.
