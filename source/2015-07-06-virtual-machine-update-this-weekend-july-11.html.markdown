We now have the new virtual machine prepared and it
passed our initial tests so we now have the exact tool
version change list, we expect this to be the complete list of updates.

The pre-installed stable Xcode version will be upgraded
from `6.3.2` to `6.4` and **we'll also start to pre-install Xcode 7 betas**,
this time `Xcode 7 beta2 (build version: 7A121l)`.

You'll be able to select Xcode 7 beta for building
with the *Select Xcode version* step once the new Virtual Machine is
published.


## Schedule & Status

**Status**: the new Virtual Machine passed our initial tests,
we'll keep testing it during the week.

The Virtual Machine update is scheduled for **Saturday, July 11, 2015**,
we'll update this section with the status of the update.

*We don't expect any downtime during the update, but build queue
times might be longer while we disconnect a set of
builder machines for the update.*


## Planned changes

*You can always check the previous and planned changes
on our [DevCenter - Virtual Machines / Box change log](http://devcenter.bitrise.io/docs/vm-box-changelog.html).*
