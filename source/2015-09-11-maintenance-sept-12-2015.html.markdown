> **Status**: we prepared everything for the migration, will start it as planned.

We've been working around the clock to improve and enhance Bitrise, and soon we're arriving to a new chapter. This new chapter will first feature our very own, [open source Command Line Interface](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise)! But to introduce it fully, we first have to migrate all steps and with it the workflows to our new infrastructure.

The downtime will last about 2 hours and it will take place on **12nd September ( Saturday ), 10:00-12:00 GMT**.
**You won't be able to start new builds at this time.**

We will auto-migrate all your existing apps and workflows in the background so you don't have to do anything. You can, however, make a backup of these before the migration and we'll also keep a copy of them for a couple of weeks. Everything should work fine, though, just in case something goes wrong during the conversion.

We will make the official announcement of the CLI soon, and it will be awesome, so hang tight! Other than that, we are on fire, so expect some neat and shiny improvements, a new devcenter and some great tutorials in the near future that will make app development even more of a joy with Bitrise.
