Useful language usage statistics for iOS developers:

> A question I wanted the answer for AppbotX recently was : "Which languages should I localize apps into?".
>
> After a bit of Googling I couldn't find answers with data to back it up, nor could I find much good data around where apps are being used.
>
> So I turned to the Appbot data to see where reviews are coming from. I believe there would be a good correlation between usage and number of app reviews left.
