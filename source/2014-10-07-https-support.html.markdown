We started to roll out our HTTPS support in the last week.
To use HTTPS you have to access bitrise with the **www.** prefix at the moment,
like this [https://www.bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).

We'll update our system to redirect from the naked urls (the ones without
the www. prefix) and from the http urls to the new https urls,
and to replace our non HTTPS dependencies.

In the meantime you can update your bookmarks to point
to **[https://www.bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io)**
instead of the old http one.
