I once attended an event where the lead designer of [Citymapper](https://citymapper.com/), Gil Wedam said, that they send out the latest version of their app every evening, so the team could test it on their way home. He went on to explain how he even takes elaborate routes home every Friday after work to push Citymapper's limits. I think it's a great attitude, and probably that's why Citymapper feels so human centered and awesome.


Now every Bitrise user can do this automatically, because we made scheduling builds happen! Just push the `Start build` button as always and switch on scheduling. You can set the time of the build and the day(s) you want that particular branch built. It's pretty easy and straightforward.
Your scheduled builds will show up on your `Builds` tab **on the day it will run**. You can delete a whole scheduling, but you can't do it for individual days. We will update this feature in the future with more advanced options, like changing an existing schedule, and managing all scheduling from a different place so you wouldn't need to wait for the day it would run to delete it.


This feature is not completed, that's why there is the `beta` tag beside it, but we thought you could still benefit from it in its current shape. We hope you'll enjoy this new automation method!


*Please spare your colleagues the displeasure of scheduling a build for Monday, 00.01, as that would mean someone has to wait for Sunday midnight to delete it... Hehe.*
