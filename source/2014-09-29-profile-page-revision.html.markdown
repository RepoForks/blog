We've updated the [Profile Page](https://www.bitrise.io/me/profile)
to get it more in line with the design of Bitrise.

It's probably not your most frequently visited page and that's
why it really matters to get it right - when you need to
visit the page you should be instantly familiar with it's structure
and be able to change your email or password, check your
account limit status and your invoices as quickly as possible.

We hope that it'll make it easier for you to manage your account
with a better user experience overall.
