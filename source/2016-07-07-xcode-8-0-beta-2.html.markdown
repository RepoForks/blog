Xcode 8.0 beta 2 is now available! ðŸŽ‰

To select this Stack you just have to **open your app** on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io),
go to the `Settings` tab, and at the bottom of the Settings tab select the `Xcode 8 beta`
stack option, and your next build will start on the Xcode 8.0 beta stack.

This new Virtual Machine replaced the previous Xcode 8.0 beta 1 configuration,
so **if you've already selected this Xcode 8 Beta stack for your app,
you're automatically using beta 2 now**.

You can find the Stack's full system report at:
[https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/blob/master/system_reports/osx-xcode-8.0.x.log](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/blob/master/system_reports/osx-xcode-8.0.x.log),
and the changes since the beta 1 stack:
[https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/commit/a659da49bd3b28b93f6ef523f589c5b08e93715a](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/commit/a659da49bd3b28b93f6ef523f589c5b08e93715a).

If you'd like to add a tool to be pre-installed on our Stacks
you can find all the required information at: [https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io#request-a-tool-to-be-pre-installed](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io#request-a-tool-to-be-pre-installed).

**Happy Building!** ðŸš€
