## What changed?

New Environment Variables for special Step related folders and files:

- $CONCRETE_FOLDER_PATH: base Concrete folder
- $CONCRETE_STEP_DATA_FOLDER_PATH: Step data folder
- $CONCRETE_STEP_FORMATTED_OUTPUT_FILE_PATH: Formatted Step output file

*You don't have to create these folders, these are part of the new OS X Box.*

> For the complete list of available Environment Variables check out the Concrete DevCenter's [Step Development](http://devcenter.concretebuilder.io/step-dev.html) page


### What is this Formatted Step Output file?

It's a special Markdown file. If this file is generated by a Step (at the *$CONCRETE_STEP_FORMATTED_OUTPUT_FILE_PATH* path) Concrete will detect it and store it for the Step and present it on the Build Details page alongside with the Step's log output.

Our **System Information Reporter** Step has been updated to generate a formatted output for the more important details. Right now it looks like this:
