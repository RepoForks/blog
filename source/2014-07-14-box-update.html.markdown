We just updated our OS X base box.


## What's updated?

* OS X: 10.9.4
* iTunes update (11.3)
* Git: 2.0.1
* Node.js: 0.10.29
* RVM: 1.25.28


## What's new?

* Go: 1.3 (with a GOPATH = $HOME/go)
* Mercurial/hg: 3.0.2

You don't have to install Go or Mercurial by yourself anymore, you can simply use these and save precious seconds from your build time!
